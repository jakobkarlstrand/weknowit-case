# Code test for We Know it

## Summary

The test was to follow a specification and wireframe from a customer and create an application in React Native with Expo. In short, the application let's you search for countries and cities around the world, and access their population.


## Process

### Design
I began with designing a prototype for the application in Figma. Can be viewed here: https://www.figma.com/file/HqKlm24Bgrii1WtQxcTkP3/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1
I tried to keep the design simple and clean, by using only a few colors.

### Research

When the design was done I started doing some research about navigation, best practices, and comparison with Reactjs etc., since I've never worked with in React Native before.

### Application structure
I took some time to get familiar with React Native by setting up all pages needed, and the ability to navigate between them.
I wrote some pseudo-code to keep everything orginized.


### API
I used, as suggested, the API "GeoNames", which I found quite tricky to read the documentation at first, but eventually got the hang of it.
I use three different requests:
* Get countries based on search
* Get cities based on search
* Get all cities from specific country

### Implementation
Once the API and the navigation worked properly, I started implementing the design and functionality.
I made a few changes of the design on the way, which is not updated in Figma.
I tried to exract code into components as much as possible. However, I feel like I could have done this better if I would redo it from scratch one more time.

## Thoughts
As I mentioned before, this is first time I've worked it React Native, and I like it! There are of course many similarities to Reactjs, but also some differences.
Overall I'm pleased with the result, and really enjoyed the test.
